Airbnb Web App
SDE Fullstack Assignment
Description
Build a functional clone of the Airbnb web application that replicates Airbnb's design, user experience, and core booking workflows.
The platform should allow users to browse and search property listings, view listing details, filter by criteria, book stays for a date range, and (as a host) create and manage their own listings, all within the clean, photo-forward interface of the original Airbnb app.
Your implementation should visually and functionally feel like a modern Airbnb marketplace. The focus is on recreating the Airbnb experience and core browse/search/booking workflows; real payments can be mocked.
Note: All data, images, media, and external services can be mocked, you do not need to integrate with any real APIs. Use placeholder or hardcoded data wherever needed to demonstrate the intended functionality.
AI Tools Usage
You are allowed and encouraged to use AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or any other AI assistant for development. Use AI as heavily as you like to move fast. However, you must understand every line of code you submit and be prepared to explain your implementation decisions during the evaluation interview.
Technical Stack
Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript)
Backend: Python with FastAPI / Django
Database: SQLite (design your own schema)
Note: real payment processing is out of scope, a mocked checkout is sufficient. Map/geolocation can be a static map image or a lightweight map library.
Core Features (Must Have)
1. Home & Search
Recreate the Airbnb home/explore view.
Grid of listing cards with photo, title, location, price/night, and rating
Search bar (location + date range + guests)
Category / filter row (price range, property type, amenities, etc.)
Pagination or infinite scroll
2. Listing Detail Page
Photo gallery
Title, description, location, amenities, host info
Availability calendar / date-range picker
Price breakdown (nightly rate × nights + fees)
Reviews section
3. Booking Flow
Implement end-to-end booking.
Select date range and guest count with validation (no overlapping/unavailable dates)
Booking summary and mocked checkout/confirmation
A “My Trips” view listing the user's bookings
All bookings must persist and block those dates on the listing
4. Host Experience (CRUD)
Implement full CRUD for listings as a host.
Create a listing (title, description, photos via URL/upload, price, location, amenities)
Edit and delete listings
A host dashboard of owned listings and their bookings
All listing data must persist
5. Airbnb Experience
The application should closely resemble the Airbnb experience, including:
Navigation and layout (explore grid + detail view)
Cards, galleries, date pickers, and modals
Search, filters, and pagination
Notifications / toasts
Wishlist / favorites (can be simple)
The goal is to make the application feel like Airbnb rather than a generic listings CRUD app.
Mocked / Placeholder Sections
The following can be present as placeholders (a simple “Coming Soon” is sufficient):
Real payment processing (mock the checkout)
Messaging between guest and host
Real-time map with live pricing pins (a static/basic map is fine)
Identity verification
Real user authentication may be simplified/mocked, but a notion of “guest vs host” is needed
Bonus (Optional)
Interactive map with listing pins
Leave a review after a completed stay
Superhost badges / ratings aggregation
Image upload to cloud storage
Dark mode
Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
Important Notes
UI Design: your application should totally resemble Airbnb's design. Study Airbnb's UI carefully before starting.
Sample Data: seed your database. Seed a variety of listings (with photos), a few users acting as hosts, and some existing bookings so the app is immediately usable.
Database Design: design your own database schema. This will be evaluated.
README File: include setup instructions, tech stack used, architecture overview, database schema, and any assumptions made.
Original Work: plagiarism from existing repositories will result in immediate disqualification.
Deliverables
Source Code: a public GitHub repository containing frontend/ and backend/.
Documentation: a README with setup instructions, architecture overview, database schema, and API overview.
Demo: a hosted, working link.
Submission
Upload your code to GitHub and ensure the repository is public.
Deploy your application (Vercel, Netlify, Render, Railway, or any cloud service).
Submit both the GitHub repository link and the deployed application link.
